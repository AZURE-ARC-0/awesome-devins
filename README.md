## [MetaGPT](https://github.com/geekan/MetaGPT)
Agent framework returning Design, Tasks, or Repo

<details>

 ![image](https://github.com/geekan/MetaGPT/raw/main/docs/resources/MetaGPT-new-log.png)

### Category
Multi-agent, Coding, Build your own

### Description
MetaGPT is a multi-agent framework
MetaGPT has existed longer than other Devin alternatives, but after the release of Devin, the MetaGPT team aims to replace most of the Devin capabilities.
MetaGPT allows the assignment of different roles to GPTs to form a collaborative software entity for complex tasks.
You can use this multi-agent framework in your own scenario to build your own application.
Internally, MetaGPT includes agents with roles of product managers, architects, project managers, and engineers.
It provides the entire process of a software company along with carefully orchestrated SOPs. Code = SOP(Team) is the core philosophy.

OpenDevin: Code Less, Make More

<details>

![Image](https://github.com/OpenDevin/OpenDevin/raw/main/logo.png)
### Category
Coding, general purpose

### Description
-  The OpenDevin project aims to replicate the original Devin model.
-  By engaging the open-source community, we aim to tackle the challenges faced by Code LLMs in practical scenarios, producing works that significantly contribute to the community and pave the way for future advancements.
- OpenDevin does code execution via Docker, but there is a work in progress with adding an option to execute code in the sandboxed environment
- It has over 20.7k stars 
The key technologies used in the project include FastAPI, uvicorn, LiteLLM, Docker, Ruff, MyPy, LlamaIndex, and React.

## [SWE Agent](https://github.com/princeton-nlp/SWE-agent)
Open-source Devin alternative

<details>

![Image](https://github.com/princeton-nlp/SWE-agent/raw/main/assets/swe-agent-banner.png)
### Category
Coding, general purpose

### Description
- This Devin alternative scores 12.3% on the FULL swe benchmark
- SWE-agent works by interacting with a specialized terminal, which allows it to:
	- üîç Open, scroll and search through files
	- ‚úçÔ∏è Edit specific lines w/ automatic syntax check
	- üß™ Write and execute tests
- This custom-built interface is critical for good performance. Simply connecting an LM to a vanilla bash terminal does not work well.
- ["Our key insight is that LMs require carefully designed agent-computer interfaces (similar to how humans like  good UI design). E.g. When the LM messes up indentation, our editor prevents it and gives feedback."](https://x.com/jyangballin/status/1775114448513958134)
- SWE-agent was released by the Princeton NLP team.
- What makes SWE-agent special is that it performs almost as well as Devin on the SWE-bench.
- It is important to say that the performance [varies](https://www.swebench.com/) based on the model used by the agent.
- The changes and innovations in SWE-agent compared to Devin are:
  - The code in SWE Agent is executed locally via Docker.
  - It uses ‚ÄúAgent-Computer Interface‚Äù (ACI) - constraining the interface makes the agent easier to use for LMs. Only a few commants are allowed: run code, look for code, edit code and submit changes to GitHub.
- Any code the agent writes goes through a syntax check (linter) before being submitted. If the syntax is incorrect, the agent gets feedback and is forced to redo the code.
- The agent can only read 100 lines of code at a time, rather than the entire file. This makes it easier for the language model to understand the code.
