### Category
Multi-agent, Coding, Build your own

### Description
MetaGPT is a multi-agent framework that, given one line requirement, returns PRD, Design, Tasks, or Repo.
- MetaGPT allows to assign different roles to GPTs to form a collaborative software entity for complex tasks
- It takes a one line requirement as input and outputs user stories / competitive analysis / requirements / data structures / APIs / documents, etc.
- Internally, MetaGPT includes product managers / architects / project managers / engineers
- It provides the entire process of a software company along with carefully orchestrated SOPs. Code = SOP(Team) is the core philosophy
- The paper about LLM-based multi-agent work spushes forward the idea of autonomous agents collaborating with each other to do more than one can on its own.
- MetaGPT incorporates efficient human workflows as a meta programming approach into LLM-based multi-agent collaboration
